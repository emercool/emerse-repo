Hadoop Project
==============
Write a Hadoop/Yarn MapReduce application that takes as input 50 Wikipedia web pages dedicated to the US states, found within states.tar.gz, and:

Computes how many times the words “education”, “politics”, “sports”, and “agriculture” appear in each file. Then, the program outputs the number of states for which each of these words is dominant (i.e., appears more times than the other three words).

Identify all states that have the same ranking of these four words. For example, NY, NJ, PA may have the ranking 1. Politics; 2. Sports. 3. Agriculture; 4. Education (meaning “politics” appears more times than “sports” in the Wikipedia file of the state, “sports” appears more times than “agriculture”, etc.)
